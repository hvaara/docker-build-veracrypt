#### Reproducible VeraCrypt build for Ubuntu 18.04 with Docker

## Downloads

It's best to always check the [VeraCrypt official downloads](https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html) in case a more recent version has been released.

### [Download the resulting binary and applicable licenses](builds/VeraCrypt_1.24-Update4) (rendered from [VeraCrypt_1.24-Update4](https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt/tree/VeraCrypt_1.24-Update4) release).

It's also recommended that you verify [your preferred checksum](#checksums).

## Introduction

Since there is no official VeraCrypt binary for Ubuntu 18.04, users must either find a binary which they trust, or compile from source.  Trust is a touchy subject when it comes to encryption software (see [Motivation](#motivation)). Compiling from source is time-consuming and disk-consuming.  But thanks to Docker, you can easily verify my build by reproducing it yourself.

## Motivation

When it comes to encryption software, it's difficult to be too careful. (For example, I'd recommend reading about both Crypto AG and the suspicious end of TrueCrypt.)  Even for the official VeraCrypt downloads, there doesn't seem to be a good way to verify that those binaries actually correspond to the source code available on GitHub.  I find it more reassuring to compile from publicly available source code.  (Even if the source code is fine, that is no guarantee that the binary will be safe. For example, see "Reflections on Trusting Trust" by Ken Thompson.)

## Challenge

There is only one real subtlety to achieving a reproducible build for VeraCrypt.  That is, that the wxWidgets 3.0 dependency uses the `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` preprocessor macros to store the compile time.  Version 3.1.1 of wxWidgets [introduced a reproducible build mode](https://github.com/wxWidgets/wxWidgets/commit/2f8a343b225e68d62f53c0908560f92b194a49c9), however VeraCrypt is only compatible with 3.0.  As a simple workaround, I replace all occurrences of `__DATE__` and `__TIME__` with a fixed value before preprocessing.

Note: Perhaps it's possible to compile VeraCrypt against some `libwx` package from Ubuntu?  (I tried briefly but was unsuccessful.)

## Build VeraCrypt with Docker

### 1. Compile under Docker.

Complete either a) or b) below.

**a) Either compile locally**

Download `Dockerfile` and change to the corresponding directory.

```
git clone https://github.com/maresb/docker-build-veracrypt.git && cd docker-build-veracrypt
```

Then build VeraCrypt.

```
docker build -t build-veracrypt .
```

**b) Or grab a premade image from Docker Hub**

Pull the image from Docker Hub and retag:
```
docker pull maresb/docker-build-veracrypt
docker image tag maresb/docker-build-veracrypt build-veracrypt
docker rmi maresb/docker-build-veracrypt
```

### 2. Copy the executable from the image via a temporary container.
```
id=$(docker create build-veracrypt)
docker cp $id:veracrypt .
docker cp $id:veracrypt_nogui .
docker cp $id:VeraCrypt_License.txt .
docker cp $id:wxWindows_Library_License.txt .
docker rm -v $id
```

### 3. Clean up.

```
docker rmi build-veracrypt
docker purge
```

### For debugging,

If the image successfully builds, you can tag the build stage and look inside with
```
docker build -t build-veracrypt:build --target build .
docker run --rm -it build-veracrypt:build /bin/bash
```
Otherwise, in the output of a partial build, look for a line with an arrow directly followed by a hash such as
```
 ---> df7f92f1a162
```
Then you can look inside at the corresponding point with
```
docker run --rm -it df7f92f1a162 /bin/bash
```

## Install any missing Ubuntu libraries

In case you are missing any libraries, the following command should install them.

Normal version:
```
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libfuse2 libgtk2.0-0 libsm6
```

No GUI version:
```
sudo apt-get install --no-install-recommends libfuse2
```

## Give it a try

By running VeraCrypt, you [agree to the licenses](#legal).

You should now be able to run `./veracrypt`, but you should
verify the checksums below.

## Install

You can install VeraCrypt with

```
sudo mv veracrypt /usr/bin/veracrypt
```

To download and install the shortcut and icon,
```
sudo wget -O /usr/share/applications/veracrypt.desktop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt/master/src/Setup/Linux/veracrypt.desktop
sudo wget -O /usr/share/pixmaps/veracrypt.xpm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt/master/src/Resources/Icons/VeraCrypt-256x256.xpm
```
